note:

1.  use "echo 0 | sudo dd of=/proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope" to set ptrace_scope to 0, this cancel the cma denied warnings.

2. The issue still occurs - at MPI_Scatter for rank 0, which is blocking
	- SOLVED: MPI_Scatter should not used within if(my_mpi_rank == 0){} scope


3. use smaller examples, i.e 4^4 input size
