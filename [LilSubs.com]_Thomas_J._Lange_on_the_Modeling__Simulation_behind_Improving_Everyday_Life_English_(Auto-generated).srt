  a mathematician is in her garden it's abeautiful spot in the country in the  middle of a kind of an open areasurrounded by pecan trees she hears theroar of a propane burner looks up and  sees this hotair balloon drifting overher place and this man yells down do you  know where I amshe says well you're at about  degrees latitude and you're about  degrees  longitude  meters off the grounddrifting about two meters a second  Southwest 

  he said you must be ascientist or a mathematician or  something she said well it turns out Iam how'd you know she said he said  because you gave me a very preciseinformation which I can do nothing with  that don't understand and it doesn'thelp me and she said you must be a  businessman from a big company probably marketing and advertising and he saidwhy yes that's true how'd you know  because you're the one in the hot airballoon drifting that way and you don't  know where you are and he said it turnsout I'm out of fuel and I have to land  and she said just over the hill there'sa river and a nice pasture you can land  so that story is a bit of a microcosm ofthe world that I've spent the last   years in a combination of businesspeople and scientists and engineers and  sometimes we don't know how tocommunicate with each other 

  so let me  start with a how a historian woulddescribe PNG we were founded in   are celebrating our hundred and seventyfifth year right this is before  electricity this is even beforerailroads were broadly we were founded  on the banks of the Ohio were the fiftholdest company on the fortune   the other ones are banks in fact I thinkwe might be the fourth Cincinnati was  the chief hog packing Center which iswhy we were there  herds of pigs traveled our streets wedidn't have Ella copters and we didn'thave to shoot them but it was the center  of pig fat and those were the rawmaterials of candles and soul and our  founders found married sisters and theirfatherinlaw said go into business  together which they did turns out in John Deere also made a plow and  founded his company out of an old sawblade in a special curved science and  engineering are 

  I have good friends atJohn Deere in my world my field and  today an American farmer feeds a hundredand fiftyfive people worldwide in   that was only twenty five point eightthat's innovation right there doing GPS  remote control of vehicles to providethat degree of automation turns out  there was another missed opportunity inPGS history Thomas Edison was a  telegraph runner between our generaloffices and the P&G candle factory you  often wonder what relationship his roleas a candle factory order runner had in  his invention of electric bulbs and theother products which today have led to  you know clearly something hightech jetengines turns out P&G didn't realize  that we didn't sell candles you see wesold light Thomas Edison understood that  years later but it turns out in spite ofthat we continued our progress and in    this was our product familymostly detergents  a we'd added other things related tofat not pig fat but Crisco was a  vegetable oil that mimicked lard and waswidely used in cooking at that time but  also we were in the world care productscrest as a brand existed then and hair  care products like prowl and lilt todayP&G is known by investors is a large  global and the largest successfulconsumer goods company about an eighty  four billion last year eleven billion inprofit we serve about four billion  consumers a year they buy it at leastonce a month we consistently build  shareholder value this is why we existas an entity we just announced our  dividend and it's we've paid dividendsconsistently since without interruption  since  and have for  yearsincreased them every year a market cap  of about  billion and the key is weinnovate to grow two billion dollars a  year in R&D now it turns out most of youconsumers would know us by our brands  right so these are our brand and in ourapproximate market size today hopefully  some of you recognize some of thesebrands and if you don't the person next  to you might have wished you had it's anold joke but it turns out brands  represent our promise which is what ourbasis touch lives and improve life it  turns out if you think about your day asyou begin your day and you walk through  that day our products touch that life ina small but important way and those  products although they began a long timeago have a heritage of innovation  so I got to answer the question in frontof a group of scientists and engineers  why brands right why don't you spendthat advertising money on the product so  I have to tell you there are two momentsof truth in our business that first  moment of truth is 

  when a purchase ismade in the store or online or wherever  and then the second one is when you getit home and use it now I want you to  imagine going to a grocery store andthere's  products they're all in  white cardboard containers with words onthem like soap you know with a  specification sheet you know shoppingwould take hours and you would still  probably bring home the wrong thing soit turns out brands are a way to make a  promise to you that is quicklyrecognized you see it turns out candles  don't represent you know candles theyrepresent light and we don't sell themanymore because people really don't use  candles for light tide represents cleannot soap in fact the recipe and formulafor Tide haven't stayed the same for I  don't know three years straight for years it represents clean and so that's  what the brand is the brand is that nowwith that I end my remarks called that  I'll call business school and modelingand you know and we're gonna move on to  now the science and engineering of theconversation so let me answer thequestion why rocket science why the  rocket science for everyday things allright what's behind them everybody gets  the fact that 

  you need science andengineering for jet engines and for even  farm machinery or military or defenseelectronics oil and gas these people  kind of get that but really seriouslyfor toilet paper for diapers you know  where's the science let's talk about


  that  it turns out in my world just as in theworld of I have two challenges around  making everyday things that improve lifeone is contradictions and the other is  scale

   so what do I mean bycontradictions so it turns out there are  our products have to perform at thatsecond moment of truth when we get themhome advertising you see creates trial  people will try something but not loyalcustomers you don't last hundreds of  years unless somebody actually thinks Imean Charmin is not a commodity productgo by commodity toilet paper anytime you  want I promiseright go buy it I doubt you'll continue  to use it actually it is a brandedproduct that you pay a premium for  because it's soft or strong and maybeyou don't but I will tell you a lot ofpeople do and it's because our the  performance of these product is drivenby fundamental science and engineering 

    contradictions contradictions inmaterials toilet paper strong but soft  stretch but not break breathe butcontain absorbent but also strong  especially when wet so here's aninteresting problem with toilet paper it  can't actually be strong in the same waypaper towels do why would that be would  mess up sewer systems 

    in fact we didmodeling and simulation of the Londonsewer system because there was a period  of time when we did make our toiletpaper too strong for London's pipes that  was an interesting model anyway theother one is packages creative design is  key right people want that immediaterecognition but things need to be strong  and light they must never leak but openeasily we're not doing so well on that  particular problem 

    right now  so let's talk about the title of my talk

    formulating for clean so you see it  turns out we wonder we're not in thebusiness of clean we're in the businessof recovering garments you don't have  disposable clothes right if you did wewouldn't have to wash them but we want  to recover them so you want to clean andremove a soil and stain but you need to  protect skin and you need to protect thefabric turns out some of the more famous  issues with laundry detergent in thelast  years was it clean great it just  ate clothes so this is one of thechallenges how to formulate for clean  and remove stain and think about what astain is it's die for for your clothespeople often complain  why doesn't detergent get out ink rightI mean 

    I have to tell you my number one  dominant garment recovery problem is theink comes out of my shirt and everybodygoes well why doesn't I get ink out and  I go oh what is ink right you want yourdocuments to go away right we couldwrite with a document and the ink goes  away it turns out it's a very hardproblem because it's a contradiction  where we want something that's permanentand so so if you could wash all the ink  off of a paper with detergent it reallywouldn't be ink would it so that's  that's a contradictionhere's another contradiction aformulation it has to be concentrated  you don't want to have massivequantities of stuff but easy to usethat's actually interesting because as  you concentrate things they get thickerand gooier and as you you know but youhave to pour it if it's a liquid and  easier we're gonna talk about that laterhere's a mixture can't separate right so  by definition you have a mixture I'm nottalking about a solution I'm talking  about a mixture but it can't separate sooil  afraid you know radiant ribbons is aproduct where you actually have two  different products but this has to be ona shelf for years and not come like turn  into one thing here's one dispenseeasily but stay put where applied for  all you who might teach fluid dynamicsclasses that's nonnewtonian fluids  right because of toothpaste wasNewtonian it would have one or two  properties it couldn't come out of thetube without a lot of pressure or if it  did it would pour all over the floorbefore you got it to the mouth so it has  to deliberately shear be formulated toshear thin which means when it moves  it's fast it's low low viscosity andwhen it stops moving it's high viscosity  that's not by accident so back to theadvertising thing how many you by show  of hands remember this product wow youactually admit you're that old we're  gonna watch a piece of advertising  I can have the cleanest washing downsalbo a dimes worth of salvo  power  tablets explodes into detergent softenerstain removers and whiteners your  detergent is okay but for big dirtywashes a dimes worth of salvo is best  until I dropped a dime in my washer Inever knew how clean my clothes could be  it's washday poor mrs. Gordon waived upCincinnati Ohio her problem  breezy wash dirty wash  introducing salvos dirt bomb here's acup of the most powerful detergent this  much more cleaning power is concentratedin a dimes worth of new salvo the  ultimate weapon in the war against dirtI tried being nice to do it with creamy  liquids and fluffy powders but now I usethe dirt bomb and blaster to smithereens  does that sound cruel well what's dirtever done for you  ah thank God those are  years old foranybody that wants to know where theword term soap opera came from right  that's where it came from we were theones that actually produced the tert you  know advertising like that I broughtthat up because that particular  advertising first of all is bad in myopinion but I you know our advertisingguys say that if you like advertising  Tom then we better change it so but thereality is why do you think they  emphasized in both those advertisementsthe exploding tablet see it turns out  because the reason why this productisn't sold anymore is because you had toput three tablets in because two of them  would end up in the pockets of yourjeans so which means you wouldn't  discover them until after you werefolding the clothes right it was justbad it did not dissolve this particular  contradiction of something that is easyto use what dissolves completely is a  very big challenge and is still achallenge today but one that we have a  product that I think has has solved thatlargely but it also shows you that in  spite of advertising and so on if theproduct doesn't work people get it stop  using it okay so those arecontradictions the second problem that  we have is scale we're in the consumergoods company there's a lot of ways we  add  billion a lot of ways to sell abillion dollars worth a goodone way is to make a submarine sell it  to the government another one is to makeseven jet fighters or you can make   airliners a hundred jet engines thatkind of thing or you can get into thetrucks tractors car business and make  hundreds and thousands of things you canhave make electronics which people thinkare masked we're in the business to make  our billion dollars of making twobillion diapers so how long do you thinkit takes us to make a billion diapers so  it's not very long we make a billiondiapers in about a week and I can show  you this video because it's really oldit's about  years old every flicker is  a diaper every little noise you hear isanother diaper being made and that's  really annoying so we're gonna stop thatthat particular but essentially think  about this why do you think we make themso fast online how much Fairtrade labor  could go into making a diaper you can'tafford to pay people to put these things  togetherI don't care where they are in the world  right milliseconds everybody from thereceptionist to the fork truck driver  from the plant engineer to the plantmanager to every Foreman in the plantright the combined total Fairtrade labor  and a diaper can be in the millisecondsthat's it so they have to be made really  really really fast and that's just thegeneral term for anything that takes  that you have to make a billion of in amatter of days or weeks now it turns out  my profession modeling and simulation isbehind the business of simulatingeverything from the atoms to the  enterprise that's involved in that fromthe formulation of our products to how  they're used by the consumers to theprocess and production systems of how  they're made and they cover the entirespectrum of science and engineering  and and in fact relate to medicine sothis is what I do for a living coolest  job in the world so let's start with afew examples computational chemistry  made the news in our most recent NobelPrize winners this is a very simple  what's called DPD simulation of how soapworks essentially you have surfactants  which carry soil beads away it'sprobably hard to see but at the far  right of the little video you see littlepieces of red getting carried away  carried away by the by the blue and infact it's important that it's moving  which is why washing machines have torotate  here's another soft nano behavior dr.Michael Klein in temple we've been  working on something called an insightaward at selforganizing organic  compounds in two by layers by layers areessentially the component around cell  walls sometimes they form by layerssometimes these by layers fall you knowrotate in on themselves and make  something called micelles and it turnsout those micelles are behind what have  make products had their Newtonian andnonnewtonian ray illogic properties  whether they form spherical rod likewormlike branched micelles and what  this nature of they are essentiallyselforganizing things that are toosmall to see with any microscopes we  know these things exist almost bycomputation more so than by anything we  can observe because they're so small andin fact we've been working with places  in Michigan in Cincinnati and Oak Ridgeto deal with how these micelles split  apart join and what they end up howbeing basically being able to predict  the rheology of the products we also itturns out this is behind laundry and  cleaning mixtures so vesicles which arebigger than a micelle by about a factor  of ten or a hundred these are closer tocell  in their size and they areselforganizing molecules that also  happen in laundry detergent and polymersare part of this and LA S stands for  surfactant it's a it's a surfactantdefinition and so these are things that  actually govern and calcium what isGaussian their water hardness right we  all know that hard water uses more soapthan soft water it turns out we know why  this is because of the role that playsin how these vesicles are formed and howthe detergents function so we also worry  about skin modeling the stratum corneumis an at the outermost layer protective  skin and is something that hasimplications for us in both personal  care and pharmaceuticals this is alsosomething we're doing with an insight  award we have about fifty six millioncore hours of computation we're using tounderstand basically the stratum corneum  model you know typically in biology weoften draw the cartoons that are on the  Left I come from a world where we wantto see them much more like they are  likely to be in the real world

    although molecules and their  representations you can't take a photomicrograph of that and see the thing on  the right but I can see it and doexperiments with it I can insult thatbilayer with ethanol and the turn  determine what happens to that layerwhich gets pretty disrupted and a lot of  movement between whereas I can alsodisrupt it with insult it with pentanewhich tends to form both of these are  either hydrophobic or hydrophilic and Ican know that ahead of time now these  are common compounds but what if I'mtrying to do that with an ingredient or  a treatment computation here has allowedus to see what is not seeable the third  pillar also though more typically incomputeraided engineering we've also  applied this we see modeling andsimulation across all these disciplines  sometimes it's only typically aapplied to solid and structural  mechanics but we see it in solids andfluids chemicals controls optimization  

    and in fact I'm going to show you someexamples in computational fluid flow  this is actually a section of a diaperline and how diapers are made we suck  material diaper and the absorbent gelyou know that stuff that you know when  your baby gets into the swimming pooland they sort of come out weighing   pounds that's that's a polyacrylate gelwell how that's deposited is a fluid  flow mechanics problem it turns out thatthe initial solve of this is a  multiphase turbulent flow withaccumulation at the boundaries problem  and that was done with CFD live which isa nuclear weapons code from Los Alamosin fact we introduced flip markers to  their code which are a marker to keeptrack of the material at the boundary  mixing liquids so you mix one of theproblems with things that are Newtonian  is mixing them so things look like icecream freezers this particular mixer  although it has really fancy blades thatlook like airplane wings isn't very good  turns out all right you pour stuff inthe top and it'll take a really really  long time for the material to work itsway to the bottom and I can do thisproblem computationally I don't have to  go out and get a hold of a footdiameter  foot time high tank and mess  around with it here's an experimentfortunately we never had to run drop  this goo in the tank and we would havebeen emptying the tank and scraping it  out and in fact what we were able toshow the people is don't use this this  is not how you mix these two thingstogether the way you mix these things  together is this way and furthermore Ican tell you what the pressure drop is  and how many mixing elements we need todo that this is something that

    essentially we're trying to replace  experiments with computation this particular article in Scientific  American I'm somewhat proud of here Maythis year talking about assembled in  code this is the latest incarnation ofthe salvo problem only we have a  dose that's and for those that mighthave known Tide Pods is one of our most  recent innovations is how do you putthree liquids in a pouch that dissolves  turns out the dissolving part isn't thehard part you know the the the filmwe've figured out the hard part is  making it and of course I'm showing thisto you because it's pilot scale and so  by my world this is really really slow Ineed to make this in much bigger form  and it turns out I need to make it muchfaster and this is still very slow  compared to what we do todayand it has to move and here's the  problem when one drop of that stuff isoutside where it's supposed to be that  pod is a leaker that leaker is in a tubwhere they're all leakers and the wholecontainer is ruined so I need part per  billion level quality control to do thisright and it turns out we did this with  modeling and simulation it seems kind ofboring but we use free surface flow  nonnewtonian computation of fluiddynamics to make sure that how fastcould we go what are the momentum where  should the drops be where should theliquid be without computing and modeling  and simulation Tide Pods would not havehappened  also packaging behind every greatpackage is a lot more than meets the eye  and this is where solid mechanics ifyou're into these sorts of things finiteelement are and in our world we tend to  deal with nonmetals and it's how thebottle is made and how strong it is  after it's made because if you make ittoo weak you have a bag with a spout and  if you make it too strong you haveplastic that has to be recycled or in a  landfill and it needs to be a geometrythat might be something interesting notjust the traditional water bottle is is  something that's made to minimizematerial but it normally doesn't deal  with geometryso we have to be able to test these  bottles without making them we have totest them you have to test them as if  they go through the Eisenhower Tunnel wehave to test them when they get strongeror weaker and we so that's one thing we  have to do another thing is we have tobe able to convey them this is our  equivalent of a racetrack about mm thisseems like an innocuous test but it's adisaster this is the anatomy of a  disaster this particular bottle what hadalready been fallen in love with by our  senior management by consumers we weresupposed to make this if this happens on  a production line you have a disaster sothis can't happen and it's really simple  it just has to do with where centers ofgravity it's it's typical kinematics  it's not even that complicated theproblem is I've got to do it before I gomake bottles and so today we do this  problem with this way and what's niceabout this is although this is also an  example of a geometry that fails I canjust have the video and say give it to a  designer and say guys this isn't goingto work we need then we can tell themwhat we want but until I show on this  they're pretty happy with the bottle buttoday I don't have to make the mold to  do that let's look at another piece ofadvertising too many men shaving is a  sensitive issue try Gillette FusionProGlide how micro thin blades are  thinner than a sheet of paper oreven a surgeon's scalpel to put less  stress on your skin by gliding throughhair fusion proglide dermatologically  tested for sensitive skin so I actuallydon't hate that advertising it was okay  but that's not why I'm showing it to youit turns out that particular part of the  advertising right there is not cartoonthat is actually a true accurate finite  element simulation of hair cutting andin fact hair itself as a material is  quite unusual people this is not likefracturing a glass rod this is much  different than that and we this is oneof the first examples where technology  from my community has actually made itinto advertising that we've used in the  market successfully automobile companiesdo this all the time but our products  you know here's the problem you know ifwe had some guy in a white coat standing  in front of a Charmin machine you knowthis big massive machine we'd probably  scare people right so so we have youknow we had mr. Whipple for years and  now now we have some cartoon bears butso sometimes you can't be too explicit  about advertising this is the one willwe could here's another thing that I'mpretty proud of this particular model is  a model of a braun shaver being droppedon a bathroom floor and the reason why i  can show it to you with such detail iswe never made this now part of it to  make this thing has  hundreds of partsin it every part has a separate mold andjust to make the prototype for this  would have taken a long time and a lotof money and it turns out this  particular design I don't know what thathappened you could you help me with that  I must have pushed some button thatbrought it back thank you so if you look  at it that particular part of the modeldidn't work that part broke  and it and it turns out that small partshave to work and everything has to work  and if I'd have made that yeah we'd havemade it physically tested it but it  would have cost a lot of money it turnsout I knew this design wouldn't work  before we ever made it and so we nevermade the part and we changed the design  and I'm not going to show you thatdesign by a braun shaver and take it  apart so here's another problem flag andstring problem is as a fluid mechanicsproblem fluid structures problem is  another challenge that particular partof a diaper the so called ear trying to  pull the flagon string through a youhave aerodynamics and structural  mechanics or for those that are in theroom that know you have an or Larian  frame of reference and little Ranjanframe of reference and you have to solvethem simultaneously it's actually much  more difficult computationally than thislittle cartoon shows but it's not a  cartoon this is a real simulation here'sa problem this is what you don't want to  have happen to a bottle of tight inWalmart I can tell you if Walmart  doesn't want to have it to happen eitherbut you especially don't and for those  that are into fracture mechanics you seesome white around where that which means  this is a ductile fracture of plastic soit seems like a pretty normal thing  right not a particularly difficultproblem but it turns out that a finite  element solution to this you see wherethe red grows what causes this is the  label panel it doesn't look like it butit actually is kind of the failurestarts from below and works its way up  to the labor label panel and then ripsand so this is an example of where I'm  work we work out what the solution wasbefore we built the prototype but I wish  I could say that but that isn't whathappened what happened was we had a  failure and I'm building a model afterthe fact and I'll talk about that in a  second 

    one of the things that I do in modeling and simulation is pathology and I really hate doing pathology because the money's already spent 

    here's an  example of what the power computer is going to do for granular saw this is just a little experiment ofgranules that are actually part of the  pure water filter we've divested thisbrand but when we owned it we studied  the actual filter granular material andwhat we cared about was where did thewater go  we took a micro CT of every singlegranule in the mix and created a finite  element model of every single granule inthe mix we then put those granules  together in a column and poured fluidthrough them and studied the  interstitial flow area of where thewater went is this so I can actually  tell you each impurity whether ittouches the granule or not by suspension  I can do that explicitly you need really big computers to do this and what would  seem like a lot of patience but what that really means is good software this  problem experimentally is almost intractable other than bulk properties  

    but I can solve this problem directlyand here's back to the never loop you  know open easily never leak but openeasily problem we're studying the  kinematics of how to open jars and itseems like a straightforward problem but  it turns out again to be a biomechanicsproblem that involves the full muscular  or skeletal activity of the you know ofthe human hand which is one of the more  complex structures around so let meclose up with some management stuff and  then we can get some questions the firstthing I want to point out is that  improving life and making dollars withMS that's our phrase for modeling and  simulation has an interesting path sofirst is you define you have to definethe problem which normally is translate  your business challenge into science andthen express those science in equationswe then have to get data and that data  can be anything it can be consumerratings plant reliability materialproperties geometry  ingredients it can be a lot of differentthings but you go get data you solve  equations and I mean equations thatnormally today involve highperformance  computing you know tens of thousands ofcores now one of the things you also  have to do back to the balloon problem Ihave to communicate the results of my  studies into the language of a businessleader I can't show half cemetry I can't  you know few simple rules right red isbad green is good red is hot blue is  cold show full geometry right moviesprogressing are normally in time those  sound like real straightforward thingsright but scientists and engineers we  are very creative about our schemes andyou know if you think about weather  think about how weather forecasters talkto us  years ago like we had to learn  in school with the little diamonds andthe half moons and the fronts and all  that are right we had to learn how toread isobars on a meteorological map on  the ten o'clock news you don't see thatstuff anymore right in other words that  is yet the simulations and model behindweather are more complex than they've  ever been but what you do to communicatethe decisionmakers are look do you needan umbrella do you have to tie down your  umbrella in your backyard what's thestory right you give people  probabilities you give them colors andmaps that make sense but the ultimate  thing is we have to shape a decisionthat means we have to reframe a question  guide a choice stop a project startsomething do something different because  you did a modeling simulation see itturns out pathology which is explain why  something that already exists orsomething that already works or doesn'twork is late it's a little too late  build your credibility if I predict whatsomeone observes it's amazing how  quickly they go wow your models areright what I really   is do virtual trialanderror nexttime come to me with your idea with your  design before it's real why don't we tryit out before it exists in the real  world and even further if you willindulge me let me help my analysis lead  your discovery and I'm gonna defineoption space narrow the choices tell you  where things work and don't work beforeyou go even try now that can be you have  to be done that has to be done carefullybecause the models better be right if  you're gonna chase people away fromspace to look but the reality is this is  where money is made so let me close witha theme for the future well first of allHPC which stands for highperformance  computing is is what's behind that infact this is a very old graph that I got  from norm Johnson at Los Alamos thattalks about the history of computing up  to the point where I was educated rightthe cray which was the first  years  of history and it turns out if we lookat that over the next the next  years  we've got to learn four new words Gigatera peda and exa because our computersare now pushing that EXA boundary so you  know what's after thatright our children will know the words  after exa deca and my favor and it'sprobably not pronounced it but I always  pronounce it Yodabecause I just think it's funny but that  those are those words and and look atthat look at that line look at that  trend these are the hype these are theworldclass machines and in fact at PG  

    the first computer I worked on which was way back then and these are the  supercomputers I work with today our supercomputing that we own that we use  every day to make the products that improve life is about a decade behind  a National Laboratory machine I say that without I say that without apology we  keep pace and we've kept pace for years and expect to keep pace for the  next  years hopefully that we continue to invest in the high performance  computing through the exascaleso our challenges are cashing in on  Moore's law one of the realities ofcashing in for us is we have to replace  our slow and expensive learning right 

    we're in the business of science and  improving life not computers we have to, and that's going to require a relentless pursuit of realism our models need to  become higher and higher fidelity because they're trying to replace more  and more complex life, but here's the thing about Moore's Law it's gonna be parallel and it's going to have bigger  data, which means we have a software challenge and at some level I'm concerned that people are not working on  software it's much more exciting to workon hardware, but not the software that  solves our problems and for those scientists in the room we must have  software that both spatially and temporally scales write finite element, and some of these other codes like molecular dynamics so scale well spatially weaning I can get ever moreatoms ever finer grids ever whatever, but  I need to compress time I need tomorrow's weather to be part of an ice  age prediction and that's a time compression problem which I don't see people working on and the final one is analysis democratizes, now what that means is they science and computational skills are going to be part of every scientists and engineers base, it isn't going to be just the realm of the computer science or just the realm of  the computational guys it is the third pillar in the sense that it will be part of all of our education. 

     imagine an engineering and science you know I can  say this because mythere is a mathematician and I would  also say my father pioneered the use ofMathematica in his school he was the  chair of the math department at Missourihe pioneered using it for the engineers  and I remember having an argument withhim I said dad wired he was teaching  this whole class of Mathematica I go whyare you doing this is in the this is inthe s so why are you doing that I said  you know they have to do tripleintegrals by hand I did so he hands methis test he goes well here's your  where's the first problem on this examsmart boy ball of radius one we're gonna  drill a core off center of  degreeswhat's the surface area of the core and  graph your result right and I'm layingit out for about  minutes and you knowI got it wrong of course but and he said  five lines of Mathematica code and hesaid you know there are some things you  just don't have to know how to do byhand and he meant me and and so the  point is why are our graduate structuralmechanics engineers after the first day  of a hand calc doing kinematics why arewe not using finite element codes why  are we not using kinematic codescomputer codes need to be an increasing  part of a scientists and engineerseducation so with that little speech the  other thing that's going to happen withdemocratising is data management is  going to end up being a bigger problemand that's gonna clearly be part of it  this isn't a big data speech so I'mgonna stay away from the rest of that  but with that I'm going to end myremarks and offer I believe to answer  some questions  well it doesn't have to be alwaysquestions Nicholas Peppers from theUniversity of Texas at Austin  okay I've worked with your company and Imust disclose that on the polyacrylic  acid super absorbanceit's a mesmerizing talk when you startedtalking I said this is going to be soft  science and you have a very nice styleto present the past I didn't know the  story about Thomas Edison but I think Iknew already what Procter & Gamble does  and what the consumer products companiesare doing in terms of computation and  this is really fascinating the verydifficult problems in fluid mechanics  the very difficult problems in packagingI remember  years ago we would go to  Continental can and American can andthey would solve quoteunquote the  problems for us and now it's not donethat way it's done in your line you know  because you're considering so manyproblems of production at the same time  not only how the product will will be have when it's in the hands of thecomputer of the consumer but much  earlier is this something that you thinkshould come in education at the level of  I mean you may your comments aboutundergraduate education but to the point  of students addressing consumer productstruly truly real products where you have  very complex geometries don't forget thegeometries that you showed for example  in one of your what was it one of thedetergents those are never discussed I  think not even in Isis I don't thinkthey do that well I I would say you know  maybe that shame on us for not being abigger part of kids education I knowintellectual property owning geometries  and shape ends up being a very ends upsometimes serving as a barrier between  industry and both training of studentsbecause what if they invent something  who's going to own it this kind ofproblem you see I sometimes call it the  Gatorade effect where states are morewe you know we get into a worry that a  state is gonna want oil teas from aninvention from one of the students intheir school and so we you know maybe  not exposed to them a consumer problembut if you take packaging just in  general you go into a grocery store Iwould challenge you that at least % of  the raw materials that are in packagesin that store shouldn't be therethey are wasted materials whether it's  the metal in the cans or whether it'sthe plastic in the bottles and it'scertainly in the cardboard that protects  the packages you know we because youknow people treat that stuff is so  lowtech then they go oh geez I'm youknow hi mom I just got my camp  mechanical engineering degree and I'mturning down the job to go work onsatellites to go work for a cardboard  company in Georgia we're gonna we'regonna make cardboard better it'll be  better I promise you now it turns outcardboard is a laminate it is a the  ultimate composite it is a flutedstructure it is a disordered web it hasadhesives that are starch based  fascinating material a hell of a lotharder to model and simulate then then  though then the fight and the compositesthat are in some of our other goods  whether we call them golf clubs orwhatever but one of the challenges we  have to overcome with our students thelowtech nature of everyday things partof the reason why I give this talk is  everyday things are as fascinating asannum and as exciting as you know whatwe might think is hightech things yes  

    that was a really really wonderful talkI enjoyed it immensely of course one of  the natural things that one is always concerned with when you look at a  computational simulations you can do you know simulation use you'd numbers of  processors  a gorgeous visualizationbut how does one know that the  simulation closely corresponds toreality and one of the this is obviously  a very practical question for you guyshow do you validate an ambitious site of  simulation simulationtechnique piece of software so it's an  excellent question and I have to answerit with two 

    I'll answer it quickly with  a story and then and then and then really answer it 

    so I'm at a conference  with automobiles with with an automobileguy from BMW in Europe and one of that  question was that he showed crash testsimulations of folks and you know how do  

    you know your crash test simulates the experiment and here was his answer he  went ooh they're still having a lot oftrouble with the experiment so and then  he didn't laugh right and and then theywere and then he just stood there and  then my audience went oh no wait aminute what is he talking about  he said let me explain he said ahandmade hand welded vehicle that's madetwo years before we've tooled the  production line doesn't is really verydifficult to make and wreck and have it  performed properly it turns out we can'treally use it for design so the only  place we can do simulation is on thefinished product that's machine made the  problem with the machine made product isall the tooling is already defined the  costs are already sunk and it betteralready passed the test and 

    he said in  the biggest problem we've got is theguys running the final crash test don't  run it correctly, and get the wrong answer so what's occurring in this third  pillar world for me is increasingly weare starting when I get a mismatch and  we get we validate the heck out of thesimulations because everyone believes  the experiment except theexperimentalist and everyone will you  know distrust the simulation guys right. I mean it's kind of like a weird thing  we do a lot of the elaborate validation experiments and in fact one of the  challenges we have to stop doing that wehave to start accepting that if the if the calculation has enough fidelity as enough foundation that the answer is probably correct and if we have an  experimental result there's something else that's missing. 

    now this  is you're hearing this from acomputational guy right my dad had probably but we have two right now one  of the frustrations I have is probably% of the spending that I do externally  is to validate experiments with with test data like skin penetration or  whatever I've got to do that with experiments 

    I'm looking forward to the  day when I don't have to when I finally have the models are high enough fidelity  in the computing is strong enough I don't have to do that anymore 


    this on  okay so this is a gender based question I was loved your example about opening  things and the human hand so clearlythere are differences in strength from  men and women from children adults etcand I've always found it challenging to  open those plastic tops in fact I haveto resort to one of those those little  things that you that's an external aidso how do you decide on the appropriate  strength needed to break the plastic sothe top can open but also to keep the  thing from spilling yeah I you know it'sit's embarrassing I'm sad to answer this  right in the progression of never leakand open easily never leak wins  okay in fact one of the problems tofinish this story I get this phone call  from I'm like Friday night I'm going outof town and I get this call oh we got  this disaster I have a whole warehousefull of Febreze in a tied bottle and  it's it's we can't open it right the captorque is that you know four hundred you  know four hundred footpounds and it'ssome sort of crazy you know have to have  a device to open it right and they saidso we're gonna put it in a warehouseovernight at ninety degrees Fahrenheit  and you know see if it softens theplastic and maybe it'll be easier and it  was like can you model that for meright I was like not a chance howeversix months ago if you would have brought  me the bottle with Febreze liquid Iwould have told you at what cap torque  it would have leaked that and so thereis a we do have standards for cap torquepart of the challenges we actually study  there are four different grips there'sthe circle grip the palm grip the finger  grip the reverse the one technique is todo the reverse grip it's a stronger grip  right but use your machine just kiddingbut we have to fix that and we are  studying into pro morphic differencesthat's why I brought it up but I've got  to do that with simulation because Ican't go recruit ten thousand people  that open bottles all day right so we'regonna we are studying that problem with  that I'm gonna
