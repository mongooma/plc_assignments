you need science andengineering for jet engines and for even  farm machinery or military or defenseelectronics oil and gas these people  kind of get that but really seriouslyfor toilet paper for diapers you know  where's the science let's talk about


  that  it turns out in my world just as in theworld of I have two challenges around  making everyday things that improve lifeone is contradictions and the other is  scale

 although molecules and their  representations you can't take a photomicrograph of that and see the thing on  the right but I can see it and do experiments with it I can insult thatbilayer with ethanol and the turn  determine what happens to that layerwhich gets pretty disrupted and a lot of  movement between whereas I can alsodisrupt it with insult it with pentanewhich tends to form both of these are  either hydrophobic or hydrophilic and Ican know that ahead of time now these  are common compounds but what if I'mtrying to do that with an ingredient or  a treatment computation here has allowedus to see what is not seeable the third  pillar also though more typically incomputeraided engineering we've also  applied this we see modeling andsimulation across all these disciplines  sometimes it's only typically aapplied to solid and structural  mechanics but we see it in solids andfluids chemicals controls optimization

"essentially we're trying to replace  experiments with computation"



I can do that explicitly you need really big computers to do this and what would  seem like a lot of patience but what that really means is good software this  problem experimentally is almost intractable other than bulk properties

I can do that explicitly you need really big computers to do this and what would  seem like a lot of patience but what that really means is good software this  problem experimentally is almost intractable other than bulk properties  

we're in the business of science and  improving life not computers we have to, and that's going to require a relentless pursuit of realism our models need to  become higher and higher fidelity because they're trying to replace more  and more complex life, but here's the thing about Moore's Law it's gonna be parallel and it's going to have bigger  data, which means we have a software challenge and at some level I'm concerned that people are not working on  software  it's much more exciting to workon hardware, but not the software that  solves our problems 

and for those scientists in the room we must have  software that both spatially and temporally scales write finite element, and some of these other codes like molecular dynamics so scale well spatially weaning I can get ever moreatoms ever finer grids ever whatever, but  I need to compress time I need tomorrow's weather to be part of an ice  age prediction and that's a time compression problem which I don't see people working on and the final one is analysis democratizes, 

now what that means is they science and computational skills are going to be part of every scientists and engineers base, it isn't going to be just the realm of the computer science or just the realm of  the computational guys it is the third pillar in the sense that it will be part of all of our education.

 how does one know that the  simulation closely corresponds toreality and one of the this is obviously  a very practical question 

- a crash test simulation - 

 we do a lot of the elaborate validation experiments and in fact one of the  challenges we have to stop doing that wehave to start accepting that if the if the calculation has enough fidelity as enough foundation that the answer is probably correct and if we have an  experimental result there's something else that's missing.
